## 🛠️ Adding This Project to Your Godot Project

### Method 1: Manual Integration (Recommended for learning)

1. **Create a new Godot project** or use an existing one

2. **Copy the file structure:**
   - Copy the `scenes/` folder into your project
   - Copy the `scripts/` folder into your project  
   - Copy the `assets/` folder into your project

3. **Set up the main scene:**
   - In Godot, go to Project → Project Settings
   - Under "Application → Run", set the main scene to your player or game manager scene

4. **Configure input maps:**
   - Go to Project → Project Settings → Input Map
   - Add the following actions:
     - `move_forward`, `move_backward`, `move_left`, `move_right`
     - `shoot`, `reload`, `weapon_1`, `weapon_2`, `weapon_3`

### Method 2: As a Godot Module (Advanced)
If you want to use this as a reusable module:

1. **Clone into modules folder:**
   ```bash
   cd your-godot-project/
   git clone https://github.com/mo-rale/top-down_game.git modules/zombie_shooter
   ```

2. **Recompile Godot** with the module included

### Key Components to Copy:

**Player Controller:**
- `scenes/player.tscn` + `scripts/player.gd`
- Handles movement, shooting, health

**Zombie AI:**
- `scenes/zombie.tscn` + `scripts/zombie.gd`
- Pathfinding and attack behavior

**Weapon System:**
- `scenes/weapons/` folder
- Weapon base class and specific weapon types

**Wave Manager:**
- `scripts/wave_manager.gd`
- Controls zombie spawning and difficulty

## 🎯 Quick Start Template

If you want to start from scratch but use similar mechanics:

1. **Create a 2D scene** with:
   - CharacterBody2D for player
   - Area2D for zombies
   - Camera2D for following player

2. **Use this basic player movement script:**
```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

var speed = 300
var health = 100

func _physics_process(delta):
    var input_dir = Vector2.ZERO
    input_dir.x = Input.get_action_strength("move_right") - Input.get_action_strength("move_left")
    input_dir.y = Input.get_action_strength("move_down") - Input.get_action_strength("move_up")
    
    velocity = input_dir.normalized() * speed
    move_and_slide()
```

## 💡 Future Plans

* Add boss waves
* Introduce player customization
* Implement multiplayer or co-op mode
* Add save/load system
* Improve graphics and UI effects
* Performance optimizations for low-end devices
